"""Validation helpers for webhook target URLs.

The dispatcher POSTs to operator-supplied URLs from inside Initiative's
network. Without a guard, a guild member could register
``http://169.254.169.254/`` (cloud metadata) or ``http://localhost:6379``
(an internal Redis) as a target — every matching event would then trigger
a server-side request to that address. Even though the response body
isn't surfaced to the caller (delivery is fire-and-log), this enables
internal port scanning and metadata-credential scraping.

The defense:

* Only ``https://`` is accepted by default. Plain ``http://`` lets a
  MITM strip the signature header and Initiative payloads at the transport
  layer, which defeats the whole point of HMAC.
* At create/update time we resolve the hostname and reject any address
  that isn't a public unicast IP (private, loopback, link-local, etc.).
* The same check runs again immediately before delivery in case DNS
  changed underneath us (rebinding) or a previously-public hostname now
  points at internal space.

The async variant (:func:`assert_target_url_is_public_async`) must be
used from any code path that runs on the event loop — :func:`socket.getaddrinfo`
is blocking and will stall every other coroutine until the resolver
returns. The sync variant exists for migrations / scripts / tests.

This is conservative — public DNS that resolves to multiple addresses
must have *all* of them pass. Operators who legitimately need to point a
hook at an internal address should run a public-facing relay.
