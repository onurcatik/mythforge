"""Generic soft-delete / restore / hard-purge service.

Single source of truth for the trash lifecycle on every entity that inherits
``SoftDeleteMixin``. Cascading is explicit (not magical): the
``CASCADE_CHILDREN`` registry below enumerates which child collections to
stamp when a parent is soft-deleted, and the inverse on restore.

Restoring an entity whose owning user has since left the relevant scope
(Initiative for Project/Task/Document/Comment/Queue/CalendarEvent) returns
``RestoreResult(needs_reassignment=True, valid_owner_ids=[...])``. The
endpoint surfaces this as 409 + the id list; the client opens a picker and
resubmits with ``new_owner_id=N`` which the service re-validates and applies
before completing the restore.

Hard-purge is admin-only at the DB layer (``RESTRICTIVE FOR DELETE`` policy
from migration 20260426_0077). For Documents (and initiatives whose cascade
includes Documents), upload cleanup runs before the DELETE so blobs on disk
and ``Upload`` rows pinned only by the doomed documents are also removed.
