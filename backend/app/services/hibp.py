"""HaveIBeenPwned Pwned Passwords client (k-anonymity).

The k-anonymity endpoint accepts the first 5 hex chars of a password's
SHA-1 hash and returns every breached hash sharing that prefix, along
with how many breaches each appears in. The full hash, and therefore
the password, never leaves the server.

Reference: https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords

Fail-open by design: any error (network, parse, timeout) is logged and
treated as "not breached". A flaky HIBP outage shouldn't block all
password changes; the length floor in ``app.core.password_policy``
still applies as a hard gate.
