"""Outbound webhook dispatcher.

When something interesting happens (``task.created``,
``task.status_changed``, …), call :func:`dispatch_event` with the event
type, scope, and payload. The dispatcher looks up matching active
subscriptions, builds an envelope, signs it with the subscription's
HMAC secret, and POSTs to the target URL.

Failure handling is intentionally permissive in v0: a subscriber that's
slow or down does NOT block the user write that produced the event.
We log and move on. Retry, dead-letter, and async dispatch (queue
worker) live in PR2.4 once we have observability of how often deliveries
fail.

Verification (the receiver's job, in Initiative-auto):

  1. Parse ``X-Initiative-Timestamp`` and reject if older than ~5 min.
  2. Compute HMAC-SHA256 over ``timestamp + "." + body`` with the
     subscription's stored secret.
  3. Compare to ``X-Initiative-Signature`` (constant-time).
  4. Dedup on ``X-Initiative-Event-ID`` so retries don't double-fire.
