"""Session-wide ORM filter that hides soft-deleted rows by default.

Wires a ``do_orm_execute`` listener that injects a
``with_loader_criteria(<Model>, deleted_at IS NULL)`` option for every
soft-deletable model into every SELECT statement issued through a Session.
SQLAlchemy applies each criterion only to queries that actually reference the
matching table, so the per-statement overhead is small.

To opt out (for the trash listing / restore endpoints), pass
``execution_options(include_deleted=True)`` either on the Session or on the
individual statement. The ``select_including_deleted`` helper wraps that for
convenience.

The list of soft-deletable models is enumerated explicitly here rather than
discovered via ``SoftDeleteMixin.__subclasses__()`` so the filter is
deterministic and survives import-order shuffles in tests.
