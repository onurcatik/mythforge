"""Trash-can endpoints: list / restore / immediate-purge.

All routes operate on the active guild (from ``X-Guild-ID``). The list
endpoint uses 9 separate per-entity queries merged in Python rather than a
literal SQL UNION ALL — pragmatic and easier to filter; the spec calls out
moving to a polymorphic trash index later if it gets slow.

Cascade dedup: children whose parent was cascaded-trashed at the same
``deleted_at`` are filtered out so the trash table doesn't list 200 tasks
under a deleted project — just the project. Restoring the parent
resurfaces the children automatically (see ``soft_delete.py``).
