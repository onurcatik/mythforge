"""Request-scoped Privileged Access Management (PAM) context.

When a request is served via a live PAM grant (rather than real membership),
the deps layer records the granted guild + access level here. The app-layer
resource access checks (`require_project_access`, `require_document_access`,
`require_queue_access`, `require_counter_group_access`) consult it so that what
a grantee can list under RLS, they can also open/edit — read-only or
read-write per the grant — without an explicit permission row.

A ``contextvars.ContextVar`` keeps this per-request (each request runs in its
own asyncio task with its own context), so there's no cross-request leakage and
the sync access helpers don't need the session threaded through them.
