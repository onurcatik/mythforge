"""Platform-level capability model.

Authorization for app-wide (platform) operations is expressed in terms of
*capabilities*, not role names. Each :class:`~app.models.user.UserRole` is a
preset that maps to a frozen set of capabilities (see ``ROLE_CAPABILITIES``).
Endpoints and services should check a capability via
:func:`user_has_capability` (or the ``require_capability`` dependency in
``app.api.deps``) so the privilege ladder can change without touching every
call site.

This is deliberately separate from *guild* roles (``GuildRole``) and
*Initiative* roles, which are scoped tenancy concepts. Capabilities here are
about platform-wide privilege.
