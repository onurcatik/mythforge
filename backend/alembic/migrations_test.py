"""Database tests for Alembic migrations.

These tests actually exercise every migration on a dedicated Postgres
database to confirm:

* a fresh database can be migrated up to ``head`` end-to-end
* each revision can be applied step-by-step from base to head (so a
  silent failure inside one migration can't be papered over by alembic
  collapsing several into a single transaction)
* the chain can be walked downward from head back to the first
  reversible boundary, then re-applied forward again — this is the
  high-value test for release rollbacks
* the alembic_version stamp matches the script directory's head
* the *most-recent* revision (head) specifically can be applied,
  rolled back, and re-applied — this is the test that fires when
  you just wrote a broken migration

These tests use a separate ``forge_migrations_test`` database so
they don't disturb the schema-stamped ``forge_test`` database used
by the rest of the suite. Roles (``app_user`` / ``app_admin``) are
PostgreSQL cluster-global and reused — the baseline migration's role
helpers are idempotent.
