"""Add soft-delete columns + RLS DELETE deny across user-facing entities.

Adds the trash-can lifecycle columns (``deleted_at`` / ``deleted_by`` / ``purge_at``)
to nine guild-scoped entity tables, plus partial indexes for the active-row hot
path and the auto-purge job. Adds a RESTRICTIVE FOR DELETE policy on each table
that admits only sessions whose ``app.current_guild_role`` is ``admin`` (or
superadmin). The ``app_admin`` role bypasses RLS entirely so the auto-purge
worker is unaffected.

Also adds ``retention_days`` to ``guild_settings`` (default 90, NULL means
"never auto-purge").
