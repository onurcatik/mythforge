//
// IMPORTANT: an action that wraps several store mutations in an *outer*
// `doc.transact(fn, origin)` must list that OUTER origin here, not the
// inner store origins. Yjs flattens nested transacts and keeps only the
// outermost origin, so "spreadsheet-sort" / "spreadsheet-structure" (the
// sort and row/column insert/delete wrappers) are what the UndoManager
// actually sees — the inner "spreadsheet-bulk" / "spreadsheet-fmt-*"
// origins never surface for those ops.
